# Legit-Bit-Blitz
A 2D sidescrolling shooter built as my Fall 2018 final CS10 project at UC Berkeley, built from scratch using Python and Pygame. Has a local two player mode and a single player mode with optional hard setting, three selectable weapons, four enemy variants, and sound effects/music. Uses command line input to customize game variables, and Pygame with mouse and keyboard input to play the game. 

Here is a demo:

The folder "AUDIO" has all the audio files.

The folder "GFX" has all the graphics and images.

The file "Mainframe.py" contains the core game mechanics and classes.

The more detailed readme has two versions, README.pdf and README.txt.

The file "Setup.py" contains the code to run the terminal setup and initialize the game window.

The file "TWOPLAYER.py" contains the game mechanics and classes for two player mode.

The file "Variables.py" contains the constants and their values.

All work on the core game and mechanics, the command line setup, as well as the single player mode was completed by myself. My partner, Nabeel Hingun, worked on the two player mode and mechanics. See README.pdf for a more detailed readme and credits.
